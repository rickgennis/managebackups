1. PERMISSIONS

To run managebackups you should first decide on a permission model.  Because it generally doesn't 
require root privileges (unless you're reading other's files) it can be setup to run as any normal
user.  The default setup stores everything in central locations so that any user can invoke it with
the same results.

    A. Default setup.
       The default locations are:

            • config: /etc/managebackups
            • cache:  /var/managebackups/cache
            • logs:   /var/log (syslog isn't used on MacOS because it goes to a database)

        These require root access to create the directories and set them SGID for the "deamon"
        user. The binary gets installed to /usr/local/bin SGID "daemon" as well. Default
        setup is enabled with a one-time run of "sudo managebackups --install".


    B.  User-specific setup.
        The file locations are:

            • config: ~/managebackups/etc
            • cache:  ~/managebackups/var/cache
            • logs:   ~/managebackups/var/log

        No root access is required for this setup.  Config and cache files created when
        user foo runs the app are not available when user bar runs it. This setup
        is enabled by specifying --user (or simply -u) on every run.


    C.  Custom setup.
        The file locations are wherever specified. The file locations can be configured for
        each run by either commandline parameter (--confdir, --cachedir, --logdir) or
        environment variable (MB_CONFDIR, MB_CACHEDIR, MB_LOGDIR). These are the only
        commandline parameter that are not automatically persisted for future runs with the
        use of the --save options.
        

2.  CONFIG

managebackups config files are plain text, editable and support comments. But rather than
learn the directive names it's far easier to craft a commandline with the desired settings and
then use the --save option to have managebackups write the config file for you.  managebackups
serves 3 functions but most uses fall into one of two classes:

        A. take and manage backups
        B. manage backups created by another tool

Though the retention policy functionality ("pruning") will work in either scenario the other 
value of managebackups is in linking identical copies of content (such as several successive
day's backups) together to save disk space. This works most effectively when every backup is
a "full," such as via tar or cpio. But it's not required. To use scenario B simply omit
the "execute a backup" parameters. See "managebackups --help" for specifics. 

The EXAMPLES section of the man page is a good next step. "sudo managebackups --install"
includes installing the man page. Or if you don't want the central /etc, /var file setup
"sudo managebackups --installman" will *only* install the man page.
