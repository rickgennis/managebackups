.SH NAME
.PP
managebackups - Take and manage backups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] [\f[I]OPTION\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] provides three functions that can be run
independently or in combination:
.SS 1. Take Backups
.PP
Backups can be configured in one of two forms:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Single file\f[R]: A single file backup is any of the standard Linux
backup commands (tar, cpio, dump) that result in a single compressed
file.
Given a backup command (tar, etc) \f[B]managebackups\f[R] will execute
the command, saving the output to a file named with the current date
(and optionally time).
By default the resulting filename will be of the form
\f[I]directory\f[R]/YYYY/MM/\f[I]filename\f[R]-YYYY-MM-DD.\f[I]ext\f[R].
When time is included the day of month is also added to the directory
structure
(\f[I]directory\f[R]/YYYY/MM/DD/\f[I]filename\f[R]-YYYY-MM-DD-HH::MM:SS.\f[I]ext\f[R]).
Note: Without time included (\f[B]\[en]time\f[R]) multiple backups on
the same day taken with the same settings will overwrite each other
resulting in a single backup for the day.
With time included each backup is saved separately.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Faubackup\f[R]: Faub-style backups, similar to the underlying
approach of Apple\[cq]s Time Machine, backs up an entire directory tree
to another location without compression.
The initial copy is an exact replica of the source.
Subsequent copies are made to new directories but are hard-linked back
to files in the the previous backup if the data hasn\[cq]t changed.
In effect, you only use disk space for changes but get the advantage of
fully traversable directory trees, which allows interrogation via any
standard commandline tool.
Each backup creates a new directory of the form
\f[I]directory\f[R]/YYYY/MM/\f[I]profile\f[R]-YYYY-MM-DD.
With the \f[B]\[en]time\f[R] option \[at]HH:MM:SS gets appended as well.
As an example, determining when /etc/passwd was changed with faub
backups can be as simple as using ls:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    laptop:\[ti]% ls -l /var/backups/*/*/*/firewall*/etc/passwd
    -rw-r--r--  56 root  wheel  2206 Dec 29 21:14 /var/backups/2023/03/01/firewall_main-2023-03-01\[at]00:15:17/etc/passwd
    -rw-r--r--  56 root  wheel  2206 Dec 29 21:14 /var/backups/2023/03/01/firewall_main-2023-03-01\[at]19:48:03/etc/passwd

\f[R]
.fi
.SS 2. Prune Backups
.PP
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] deletes old backups that have aged out.
The retention critera is configured on a daily, weekly, monthly and
yearly basis.
By default \f[B]managebackups\f[R] will keep 14 daily, 4 weekly, 6
monthly and 2 yearly backups.
Additionally, \f[B]managebackups\f[R] can perform a second level of
pruning called consolidation.
If elected, multiple backups taken on the same day can be consolidated
down to a single per day backup after said backup has reached a
specified age.
The default is no consolidation.
.SS 3. Hard Linking
.PP
In configurations using a single file backup where all backups are
fulls, and therefore many are potentially identical,
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] can save disk space by hard linking identical
copies together.
This is done by default when identical copies are identified.
In Faub-style backups hard linking is automatically implemented on a
per-file basis.
.SH PROFILES
.PP
Backup profiles are a collection of settings describing a backup set
\[en] its directory to save backups to, the command to take the backups,
how many weekly copies to keep, etc.
Once a profile is associated with a collection of options, all of those
options are invoked when the profile is specified, unless an overriding
option is also given on the commandline.
There are three types of profiles:
.SS Single File Backup Profile
.PP
These specify the settings to perform a single-file backup.
The distinct directives to make it single-file are `command' and `file'.
`faub' is not applicable.
.SS Faub-style Backup Profile
.PP
These specify the settings to perform a Faub backup.
The distinct directive to make it Faub is `faub'.
`command' and `file' are not applicable.
.SS Faub client Profile
.PP
Faub backups require an instance of \f[B]managebackups\f[R] running in a
server capacity and a client capacity.
If you\[cq]re backing up a remote server that remote server will run the
client version.
The client side can be invoked with the \f[B]-s\f[R] or
\f[B]\[en]path\f[R] directive, a setup which doesn\[cq]t require a
profile (or config file) on the client side.
Alternatively if there are multiple directives (such as `path',
`include', `exclude') it may be simpler to create a client side profile
that can be invoked with \f[B]-p\f[R].
See FAUB-STYLE BACKUPS below.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options are categorized by the three functions of
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] plus general options.

Show the top \f[I]number\f[R] files.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]test\f[R]
Run in test mode.
No changes are actually made to disk (no backups, pruning or linking).
.TP
\f[B]\[en]default\f[R]
Tag the current profile as the default one; only useful with
\f[B]\[en]save\f[R].
Not to be confused with \f[B]\[en]defaults\f[R].
See DEFAULT PROFILE below.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]defaults\f[R]

.TP
\f[B]\[en]nocolor\f[R]
Disable color on console output.
.TP
\f[B]-q\f[R], \f[B]\[en]quiet\f[R]
Quiet mode is to minimize output; useful for cron invocations where
important messages will be seen in the log or via \f[B]\[en]notify\f[R].
When used with \f[B]-1\f[R] it supresses header rows and color output
(i.e.\ \f[B]\[en]nocolor\f[R]) to facilitate script processing.
.TP
\f[B]-b\f[R], \f[B]\[en]blocks\f[R]
By default faub backup size values are displayed in bytes (KB, MB, GB,
etc).
Use \f[B]\[en]blocks\f[R] to instead display disk usage in terms of
512-byte blocks, like the the `du' command.
This is only relevant for faub-style backups.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]confdir\f[R] [\f[I]dir\f[R]]
Use \f[I]dir\f[R] for all configuration files.
Defaults to /etc/managebackups.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]cachedir\f[R] [\f[I]dir\f[R]]
Use \f[I]dir\f[R] for all cache files.
Defaults to /var/managebackups/caches.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]logdir\f[R] [\f[I]dir\f[R]]
Use \f[I]dir\f[R] for all log files.
Defaults to /var/log if writable by the process, otherwise the
user\[cq]s home directory.
.TP
\f[B]-u\f[R], \f[B]\[en]user\f[R]
Set all three directories (config, cache and log) to use the calling
user\[cq]s home directory (\[ti]/managebackups/).
Directory setting precedence from highest to lowest is a specific
commandline directive (like \f[B]\[en]confdir\f[R]), then
\f[B]\[en]user\f[R], and finally environment variables (shown below).
.TP
\f[B]-x\f[R], \f[B]\[en]lock\f[R]
Lock the specified profile (or all profiles if \f[B]-a\f[R] or
\f[B]-A\f[R]) for the duration of this run.
All subsequent attempts to run this profile while the first one is still
running will be skipped.
The profile is automatically unlocked when the first invocation
finishes.
Locks are respected on every run but only taken out when \f[B]-x\f[R] or
\f[B]\[en]lock\f[R] is specified.
i.e.\ a \f[B]-x\f[R] run will successfully lock the profile even for
other invocations that fail to specify \f[B]-x\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]-f\f[R], \f[B]\[en]force\f[R]
If used when executing a profile \f[B]\[en]force\f[R] will override any
existing lock and force the profile to run (backup, prune, etc).
If used with \f[B]\[en]relocate\f[R], \f[B]\[en]force\f[R] will make
every attempt to continue a previously failed \f[B]\[en]relocate\f[R] by
handling errors.
Some assumptions are made in this context.
For example, if a backup is to be renamed A to B and A no longer exists
but B already does, it\[cq]s assumed to have previously succeeded and
processing continues.
If a symlink needs to be created and is found to already exist, its
deleted and recreated automatically.
If used with \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] or \f[B]\[en]Diff\f[R] the Full Changes
form of the diff will be run instead of the Cached Changes.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]tripwire\f[R] [\f[I]string\f[R]]
The tripwire setting can be used as a rudimentary guard against
ransomware or other encryption attacks.
It can\[cq]t protect your local backups but will both alert you
immediately and stop processing (no pruning, linking or backing up) if
the tripwire check fails.
The check is defined as a filename (or list of filenames) and their MD5
values.
If any of the MD5s change, the check fails and the alert is triggered.
For example, if you\[cq]re backing up /etc you can create a bogus test
file such as /etc/tripdata.txt and then configure
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] with \f[B]\[en]tripwire \[lq]/etc/tripdata.txt:
xxx\[rq]\f[R] where xxx is the correct MD5 of the file.
Multiple entries can be separated with commas (\[lq]/etc/foo: xxx,
/etc/fish: yyy, /usr/local/foo: zzz\[rq]).
Only local computer tripwire files are supported at this time.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] [\f[I]backup\f[R]]
{FB} Display the differences (files that have changed) between backups.
\f[I]backup\f[R] can be a partial string that matches any unique backup
within the profile.
If \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] is specified once, its performed on the matching
backup and the chronologically previous backup.
If \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] is specified twice, the two given backups are
diff\[cq]d.\ \f[B]\[en]force\f[R] can be used to generate the full
version of the diff when \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] is only specified once.
Note that if a file exceeds \f[B]\[en]maxlinks\f[R] and gets assigned a
new inode (even though the file content is identical) it will also show
up in a \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R].
See \f[B]\[en]threshold\f[R].
See EXAMINING BACKUPS below for full detail.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]Diff\f[R] [\f[I]backup\f[R]]
{FB} Directories & symlinks can\[cq]t be hardlinked, meaning they would
show up on every \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] even if the data hasn\[cq]t
changed.
To help focus on actual changes \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] filters those out.
\f[B]\[en]Diff\f[R] provides the same functionality, but includes the
directories & symlinks.
\f[B]\[en]Diff\f[R] unfiltering only applies to Full Changes diffs (see
EXAMINING BACKUPS).
.TP
\f[B]\[en]last\f[R]
{FB} Perform a diff (see \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R]) on the most recent backup
in the profile without having to specify that backup.
Can be combined with \f[B]\[en]force\f[R] and/or
\f[B]\[en]threshold\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\[en]threshold\f[R] [\f[I]limit\f[R]]
{FB} Specify a threshold to filter \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] or
\f[B]\[en]Diff\f[R] listings.
\f[I]limit\f[R] is assumed to be in bytes unless a suffix is specified
(K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y).
Alternatively \f[I]limit\f[R] can be a percentage (e.g.\ 25%).
If the absolute value of the difference between the size of the file in
backupA and the size of the file in backupB is greater than or equal to
the \f[I]limit\f[R] then the file is included in the output.
A file that exists in only one of the two backups matches any
percentage.
Defaults to 0 to include all changes.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]relocate\f[R] [\f[I]newDir\f[R]]
Relocating backups for a profile entails updating the internal caches,
updating the profile\[cq]s configuration and moving all the backups\[cq]
files in a hardlink-aware way.
The \f[B]\[en]relocate\f[R] option handles all three of these.
Use it in conjunction with \f[B]-p\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\[en]replicateto\f[R] [\f[I]targetDir\f[R]]
{FB} The replicate option makes a hardlink-aware copy (i.e.\ no
appreciable additional storage) of the most recent backup of the
specified (\f[B]-p\f[R]) profile to the \f[I]targetDir\f[R].
The copy is placed directly in \f[I]targetDir\f[R] with no year, month
or day subdirectories.
This is useful for when you want to store a copy of your faub-style
backup in a cloud syncing service (Apple\[cq]s iCloud Drive,
Microsoft\[cq]s OneDrive, etc).
By replicating to a directory in one of your cloud synced services, you
can gain off-site replication of a single backup.
Without the replicate option, the choices would be to create a symlink
in your cloud sync directory to where your backups are housed \[en] this
would be useless because the cloud providers don\[cq]t follow links,
resulting in no backup making it to the cloud.
Or you would have to store all of your backups in the cloud sync
directory, resulting in a larger cloud bill because the provider would
ignore the hardlinks and see each copy as additional storage.
The copy of the backup in \f[I]targetDir\f[R] is not tracked and
doesn\[cq]t not appear in \f[B]-1\f[R] output.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]rmo\f[R] [\f[I]num\f[R]]
{FB} Remove the \f[I]num\f[R] oldest backups from the specified profile
(\f[B]-p\f[R]).
This can also be done manually from the commandline via \[lq]rm -rf\[rq]
and caches would be updated automatically on the next run.
This is purely a convenience function.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]rmn\f[R] [\f[I]num\f[R]]
{FB} Remove the \f[I]num\f[R] newest (most recent) backups from the
specified profile (\f[B]-p\f[R]).
This can also be done manually from the commandline via \[lq]rm -rf\[rq]
and caches would be updated automatically on the next run.
This is purely a convenience function.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]sched\f[R] [\f[I]hours\f[R]]
Schedule (via LaunchCtl on MacOS or cron on Linux)
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] to run every \f[I]hours\f[R] hours with the
\[lq]-K\[rq] option.
If \f[I]hours\f[R] is 0 or 24 it\[cq]s interpreted as once a day and
will default to 00:15 in the morning.
If set to run once a day \f[B]\[en]schedhour\f[R] can be specified to
use a different single hour.
\f[B]\[en]schedminute\f[R] can be used to specify a different minute
offset.
\f[B]\[en]schedpath\f[R] can be used to specify an alternative location
if \f[B]managebackups\f[R] isn\[cq]t installed in /usr/local/bin.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]schedhour\f[R] [\f[I]hour\f[R]]

See \f[B]\[en]sched\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\[en]recalc\f[R]
Recalcuate all disk usage for a profile.
Use with -p.\ This should never be necessary unless you manually modify
a backup.
.TP
\f[B]-v\f[R][\f[I]options\f[R]]
Provide verbose debugging output.
Brilliant (albeit overkill in this situation) debugging logic borrowed
from Philip Hazel\[cq]s Exim Mail Transport Agent.
\f[B]-v\f[R] by itself enables the default list of debugging contexts.
Contexts can be added or subtracted by name.
For example, \f[B]-v+cache\f[R] provides the default set plus caching
whereas \f[B]-v-all+cache\f[R] provides only caching.
\f[B]-v+all\f[R] gives everything (\f[B]\[en]vv\f[R], two dashes, two
v\[cq]s, is a synonym for all).
Longer combinations can be strung together as well
(\f[B]-v-all+cache+prune+scan\f[R]).
Note spaces are not supported in the -v string.
Valid contexts are:

It can still be run manually via \f[B]\[en]profile\f[R].
Even on a manual run, pruning is disabled for Archive profiles, unless

\f[B]\[en]faub\f[R] [\f[I]cmd\f[R]]
{FB} Use \f[I]cmd\f[R] to perform a Faub-style backup.
\f[I]cmd\f[R] should be double-quoted.
Ultimately \f[I]cmd\f[R] should execute \f[B]managebackups\f[R] with
\f[B]\[en]path\f[R] or \f[B]-s\f[R] on the server to be backed up.
If the backup is of the localhost \f[I]cmd\f[R] can simply be
\[lq]managebackups -s filesystemToBeBackedup\[rq].
If the backup is of a remote host \f[I]cmd\f[R] needs to execute
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] on that remote server, such as via ssh.
See the FAUB-STYLE BACKUPS section below.
.TP
\f[B]-c\f[R], \f[B]\[en]command\f[R] [\f[I]cmd\f[R]]
{1F} Use \f[I]cmd\f[R] to perform a single-file backup.
\f[I]cmd\f[R] should be double-quoted and may include as many pipes as
desired.
Have the command send the backed up data to its STDOUT.
For example, \f[B]\[en]cmd\f[R] \[lq]tar -cz /mydata\[rq] or
\f[B]\[en]cmd\f[R] \[lq]/usr/bin/tar -c /opt | /usr/bin/gzip -n\[rq].
\f[B]-c\f[R] is replaced with \f[B]\[en]faub\f[R] in a faub-backup

.TP
\f[B]\[en]uid\f[R] [\f[I]uid\f[R]]
{1F} chown newly created backups to \f[I]uid\f[R], which is specified as
an integer.
Defaults to the effective executing user.
Use 0 to specify the real executing user.
For root, leave it unset and run as root.
Note: This option only impacts single-file backups; with Faub-style
backups files are set to the uid/gid of the remote system if possible
(i.e.\ if run as root or suid), otherwise they remain owned by the
executing user.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]gid\f[R] [\f[I]gid\f[R]]
{1F} chgrp newly created backups to \f[I]gid\f[R], which is specified as

Defaults to the effective executing user\[cq]s group.
Note: This option only impacts single-file backups; with Faub-style
backups files are set to the uid/gid of the remote system if possible
(i.e.\ if run as root or suid), otherwise they remain owned by the
executing user.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]time\f[R]
{both} Include the time in the filename of the newly created backup.
The day of month will also be included in the subdirectory.
Without time included multiple backups on the same day taken with the

With time included each backup is saved separately.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]notify\f[R] [\f[I]contact1\f[R],\f[I]contact2\f[R],\&...]
{both} Notify after a backup completes.
By default, only failed backups/SFTP/SCP trigger notifications (see
\f[B]\[en]nos\f[R]).
A contact can be an email address or the full path to a script to
execute.
Double-quote the contact string if it contains any spaces.

\f[I]size\f[R] can be a specific number (e.g.\ \[lq]2G\[rq],
\[lq]500K\[rq], etc) or a percentage (e.g.\ \[lq]80%\[rq]).
The average size is calculated from the most recent 10 backups.
For single-file backups, the full size of the backups are being

\f[B]\[en]scp\f[R] [\f[I]destination\f[R]]
{1F} On completion of a successful backup, SCP the newly created backup
file to \f[I]destination\f[R].
\f[I]destination\f[R] can include user\[at] notation and an optional
hardcoded filename.
If filename is omitted the newly created date-based filename is used,
the same as with a standard cp command.
Additionally the strings {fulldir}, {subdir} and {filename} can be used;
they\[cq]ll be automatically replaced with the values relative to the
newly created backup.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]sftp\f[R] [\f[I]destination\f[R]]
{1F} On completion of a successful backup, SFTP the newly created backup
file to \f[I]destination\f[R].
\f[I]destination\f[R] can include user\[at] notation, machine name
and/or directory name.
SFTP parameters (such as -P and others) can be included as well.
Additionally the strings {fulldir}, {subdir} and {filename} can be used;
they\[cq]ll be automatically replaced with the values relative to the
newly created backup.
By default, a current year and month subdirectory will be created on the
destination after connecting and then the file is \[lq]put\[rq] into
that directory.
Use a double-slash anywhere in the \f[I]destination\f[R] to disable
creation and use of the YEAR/MONTH subdirectory structure on the

{FB} Only backup directory entries that do NOT match the specified regex
pattern.
By default this option only filters files and continues to include
subdirectories themselves (files in the subdirectories are filtered).
To have it apply to the subdirectories see \f[B]\[en]filterdirs\f[R].
Also note, this is applicable for the client invocation of
\f[B]managebackups\f[R], the one run with \f[B]\[en]path\f[R].
To minimize complexity the server side innovation understands
\f[B]\[en]exclude\f[R] and will automatically append it to the
client-side call (\f[B]\[en]faub\f[R]) if found.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]filterdirs\f[R]
{FB} Apply \f[B]\[en]include\f[R] or \f[B]\[en]exclude\f[R] filtering to
subdirectory names.
.TP
\f[B]-s\f[R], \f[B]\[en]path\f[R] [\f[I]path\f[R]]
{FB-remote} Specifies which directories to backup in a faub-style
backup.
This option is only used on the REMOTE end, i.e.\ the server being
backed up.
See the FAUB-STYLE BACKUPS section below.
Multiple paths can be specified via quoted parameters that are space
delimited (\[en]path \[lq]/usr /usr/local /root\[rq]) or multiple
directives (\[en]path /usr \[en]path /usr/local).
Note: If specified on the commandline and in a selected profile, the
commandline paths replace \f[I]all\f[R] of the ones in the profile for
that one.
.SS 2. Pruning Options
.TP
\f[B]\[en]prune\f[R]
By default, \f[B]managebackups\f[R] doesn\[cq]t prune.
Pruning can be enabled with this option or via the config file.
To enable pruning moving forward use \f[B]-p\f[R], \f[B]\[en]save\f[R],
and \f[B]-prune\f[R] together.
Then future runs of that profile will include pruning.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]noprune\f[R]
Disable pruning (when previously enabled) for this run.
Like other options, to make this permanent for the profile moving
forward add \f[B]\[en]save\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]-d\f[R], \f[B]\[en]days\f[R], \f[B]\[en]daily\f[R]
Specify the number of daily backups to keep.
Defaults to 14.
.TP
\f[B]-w\f[R], \f[B]\[en]weeks\f[R], \f[B]\[en]weekly\f[R]
Specify the number of weekly backups to keep.
Defaults to 4.
.TP
\f[B]-m\f[R], \f[B]\[en]months\f[R], \f[B]\[en]monthly\f[R]
Specify the number of monthly backups to keep.
Defaults to 6.
.TP
\f[B]-y\f[R], \f[B]\[en]years\f[R], \f[B]\[en]yearly\f[R]
Specify the number of yearly backups to keep.
Defaults to 2.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]consolidate\f[R] [\f[I]days\f[R]]
Prune backups down to a single backups per day once they\[cq]re
\f[I]days\f[R] days old.
If you take multiple backups of the same profile in the same day (with
\f[B]\[en]time\f[R]), this allows you to keep only a single one after
they age to \f[I]days\f[R] days but haven\[cq]t reached the full
retention policy to be completely deleted.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]dataonly\f[R]
{FB} Only retain backups with changed data.
Backups with no changes (identical copies of the previous backup) are
removed on the next run.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]fs_days\f[R] [\f[I]days\f[R]]
Failsafe - Require \f[I]backups\f[R] backups (see
\f[B]\[en]fs_backups\f[R]) within the last \f[I]days\f[R] days before
pruning will begin.
See FAILSAFE below.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]fs_backups\f[R] [\f[I]backups\f[R]]
Failsafe - Require \f[I]backups\f[R] backups within the last
\f[I]days\f[R] days (see \f[B]\[en]fs_days\f[R]) before pruning will
begin.
See FAILSAFE below.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]fs_limit\f[R] [\f[I]backups\f[R]]
Failsafe - Limit pruning to a max of \f[I]backups\f[R] backups per run.
i.e.\ if \f[I]backups\f[R] is 4 then no more than 4 backups will be
pruned for the current profile per run.
See FAILSAFE below.
.TP
\f[B]\[en]fp\f[R]
Failsafe paranoid - See FAILSAFE below.
.SS 3. Linking Options
.TP
\f[B]-l\f[R], \f[B]\[en]maxlinks\f[R] [\f[I]links\f[R]]
Use \f[I]links\f[R] as the maximum number of links for a backup.
For example, if the max is set to 10 and there are 25 identical content
backups on disk, the first 10 all share inodes (i.e.\ there\[cq]s only
one copy of that data on disk for those 10 backups), the next 10 share
another set of inodes, and the final 5 share another set of inodes.
From a disk space and allocation perspective those 25 identical copies
of data are taking up the space of 3 copies, not 25.
In effect, increasing \f[B]\[en]maxlinks\f[R] saves disk space.
But an accidental mis-edit to one of those files could damage more
backups with a higher number.
Set \f[B]\[en]maxlinks\f[R] to 0 or 1 to disable linking.
Defaults to 200.
.SH NOTIFICATIONS
.PP
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] can notify on success or failure of a backup via
two methods: email or script.
Multiple emails and/or scripts can be specified for the same profile.
.SS Email Notifications
.PP
Notifications are sent to all email addresses configured for the current
profile on every failure.
Notifications are only sent on successes if Notify On Success
(\f[B]\[en]nos\f[R]) is also specified.
.SS Script Notifications
.PP
By default notification scripts configured for the current profile are
only considered on a state change.
A state change is defined as a backup succeeding or failing when it did
the opposite in its previous run.
On a state change, all notification scripts for the profile will be
executed if the backup failed.
State changes that change to success are only notified if Notify On
Success (\f[B]\[en]nos\f[R]) is also specified.
In effect, this means the script(s) will only be called for the first in
a string of failures or, with \f[B]\[en]nos\f[R], a string of successes.
When \f[B]\[en]notifyevery\f[R] is set to a non-zero number
(\f[I]count\f[R]) a string of successive failures will execute the
notify script on every \f[I]count\f[R] failure.
i.e.\ if \f[I]count\f[R] is 5 and there\[cq]s a contiuous succession of
failures, every 5th one will run the script, in addition to the first
failure.
.PP
Notification scripts are passed a single parameter, which is a message
describing details of the backup event.
.SH FAILSAFE
.PP
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] can use a failsafe check to make sure that if
backups begin failing, it won\[cq]t continue to prune (remove) old/good
ones.
The failsafe check has two components: the number of successful backups
required (B) and the number of days (D) for a contextual timeframe.
To pass the check and allow pruning, there must be at least B valid
backups within the last D days.
These values can be specified individually via \f[B]\[en]fs_backups\f[R]
and \f[B]\[en]fs_days\f[R].
By default the failsafe check is disabled.
.PP
The failsave also has a limit option, \f[B]\[en]fs_limit\f[R].
When a limit is given, it\[cq]s interpreted as the maximum number of
backups to prune for this profile in a single run.
.PP
Rather than specifying the settings individually, there\[cq]s also a
Failsafe Paranoid option (\f[B]\[en]fp\f[R]) which sets backups to 1,
days to 2, and limit to 2.
In other words, there has to be a valid backup within the last two days
before pruning is allowed; and if allowed, a max of 2 backups will be
pruned per run.
.SH PROFILE CONFIG FILES
.PP
Profile configuration files are managed by \f[B]managebackups\f[R]
though they can be edited by hand if that\[cq]s easier than lengthy
commandline arguments.
Each profile equates to a .conf file under /etc/managebackups.
Commandline arguments are automatically persisted to a configuration
file when both a profile name (\f[B]\[en]profile\f[R]) and
\f[B]-save\f[R] are specified.
Comments (#) are supported.
.SH FAUB-STYLE BACKUPS
.PP
Faub-style backups require \f[B]managebackups\f[R] to be installed on
both the backup server and the server being backed up.
In most cases, both invocations will need to be run as root in order to
replicate the file owners/groups/perms from one machine to the other.
On the server side (the machine doing the backing up) the configuration
will require:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\[en]directory\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\[en]faub\f[R]
.PP
\f[I]not\f[R] \f[B]\[en]command\f[R] or \f[B]\[en]file\f[R].
The \f[B]\[en]faub\f[R] parameter is the remote (likely ssh) command
that invokes \f[B]managebackups\f[R] on the machine to be backed up.
The only parameter the remote invocation of \f[B]managebackups\f[R]
requires is \f[B]\[en]path\f[R] to specify the directory to backup.
\f[B]\[en]path\f[R] can be specified multiple times.
For a more secure setup, create a new user on the machine that\[cq]s
being backed up and only allow it to execute \f[B]managebackups\f[R]
with the exact parameters required.
For example, if you make `backupuser' on the remote `dataserver', you
might include something like this in
\[ti]backupuser/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on dataserver:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
from=\[dq]192.168.0.0/24\[dq],command=\[dq]sudo managebackups --path /usr/local/bin\[dq] ssh-rsa........<user\[aq]s ssh key>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
to backup /usr/local/bin, assuming your backup server is connecting from
192.168.0.0/24 and you\[cq]ve allowed backupuser to sudo the command
with NOPASSWD on dataserver.
Alternatively, if you\[cq]ve run \f[B]managebackups
\[en]installsuid\f[R] on dataserver the `sudo' can be omitted.
With this setup the \f[B]\[en]faub\f[R] parameter of your
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] profile configuration could be as simple as:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--faub \[dq]ssh dataserver\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Without the authorized_keys2 file you would need the options in your
faub config directly:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--faub \[dq]ssh dataserver sudo managebackups --path /usr/local/bin\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Another simplification would be to create a profile (for example,
\[lq]dataclient\[rq]) on the dataserver that includes the `path'
directive and any others desired options (include, exclude, filterdirs,
etc).
Then the \[en]faub command on the server could become:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--faub \[dq]ssh dataserver sudo managebackups -p dataclient\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Complications with configuration of faub, particularly if ssh is
involved, are much easier to debug given the output of the various
subcommands.
See \f[B]\[en]leaveoutput\f[R].
.SH EXAMINING BACKUPS
.PP
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] provides two methods to inspect the difference
between individual Faub-style backups within a profile.
.SS Type: Cached Changes
.PP
Cached changes are saved when a backup is taken.
They provide minimal detail (only the filename), are instantaneous to
retrieve, and relative to the chronologically previous backup at the
time it was taken.
That means if the previous backup is deleted the cached output
\[en]which doesn\[cq]t change\[en] will be showing the diffs to a now
non-existent backup, \f[I]not\f[R] to what now appears to be the
previous backup.
Cached changes only list files that were added or modified, not deleted.
.SS Type: Full Changes
.PP
Full changes provide all detail: files that were added, modified or
deleted, how much the size of the file changed up or down and whether
it\[cq]s a link, directory or regular file.
Because \f[B]managebackups\f[R] has to walk the filesystem to determine
the differences, this approach is slower.
A full changes diff can be requested of any two backups within the
profile, unlike cached changes, which will always compare to the
immediately previous one.
.SS General
.PP
The \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] [\f[I]backup\f[R]] command, if only specified
once, will default to Cached Changes and show the changes between the
specified \f[I]backup\f[R] and the immediately previous one (at the time
it was taken).
Use \f[B]\[en]force\f[R] to generate the Full Changes diff instead.
When \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] [\f[I]backup\f[R]] is specified twice
(i.e.\ which two backups to compare), it always does a Full Changes
diff.
Note: Because symlinks and directories can\[cq]t be hardlinked they
always show up as changes and are automatically filtered out of the
\f[B]\[en]diff\f[R] output.
To include them use \f[B]\[en]Diff\f[R] instead.
\f[B]\[en]threshold\f[R] can be used to further filter the output to
only show files that have changed by a certain size or more.
\f[B]\[en]last\f[R] can be used as a shortcut to run \f[B]\[en]diff\f[R]
on the most recent backup without having to specify the backup itself.
.SH TAGGING & HOLDING
.PP
Tags can be used to identify and track specific backups within or across
profiles.
A tag can be applied when a backup is taken or after the fact.
Tags can be specified with \f[B]-1\f[R] to see only the backups that
match a given tag.
Multiple backups can be given the same tag and multiple tags can be
given to the same backup (many to many).
.PP
Holding is a method of keeping a backup after its aged out of the
configured daily/weekly/monthly/yearly quota.
A hold can be set on a backup in either relative terms (x amount of time
from when the hold is set) or absolute terms (a specific date).
Relative holds are specified as a number of days, week, months and/or
years.
For purposes of a hold a month is calculated as 30 days.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    * 6w for 6 weeks
    * 1y2m3d for 1 year, 2 months and 3 days
    * 12/31 for the end of the current year
    * 10/12/2025 for a specific date
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Tagging (backup organization) and holding (deletion prevention) can be
used independently.
They can also be associated together.
A given tag can be assigned a hold time (relative or absolute) such that
any time the tag is applied, the associated hold time is also applied.
See \f[B]\[en]maptaghold\f[R] for details.
.SH PERMISSIONS
.PP
Aside from access to read the files being backed up (on a remote server
or locally) \f[B]managebackups\f[R] requires local write access for
multiple tasks:
.IP \[bu] 2
writing to the log file (default /var/log/managebackups.log)
.IP \[bu] 2
writing its cache files (default /var/managebackups/caches)
.IP \[bu] 2
creating the local backup in the configured directory
.IP \[bu] 2
setting owners/groups/perms on faub-style backup files
.PP
The first three of these can be achieved by moving the log/cache/backup
files into a directory that \f[B]managebackups\f[R] has write access to.
Alternatively, \f[B]managebackups\f[R] can be made suid or sgid (see
\f[B]\[en]install\f[R] and \f[B]\[en]installsuid\f[R]).
The fourth permission issue has no workaround.
If you wish to use faub-style backups \f[B]managebackups\f[R] needs to
run as root either via \f[B]\[en]installsuid\f[R], sudo or via the root
user.
Without root access faub-style backups can be created but all files will
have the same owner.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
Environment variables are overriden by \f[B]\[en]user\f[R],
\f[B]\[en]confdir\f[R], \f[B]\[en]cachedir\f[R], and
\f[B]\[en]logdir\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]MB_CONFDIR\f[R]
Directory to use for configuration files.
See also \f[B]\[en]confdir\f[R].
Defaults to /etc/managebackups.
.TP
\f[B]MB_CACHEDIR\f[R]
Directory to use for cache files.
See also \f[B]\[en]cachedir\f[R].
Defaults to /var/managebackups/caches.
.TP
\f[B]MB_LOGDIR\f[R]
Directory to use for logging.
See also \f[B]\[en]logdir\f[R].
Defaults to /var/log if writable by the process, otherwise the
user\[cq]s home directory.
.SH DEFAULT PROFILE
.PP
On a system with multiple profiles where one is used most of the time
that profile can be made the default.
A default profile is automatically selected, without the need to specify
it via \f[B]-p\f[R] for the following options:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    --diff
    --Diff
    --last
    --recalc
    --go
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Even with a default specified \f[B]-p\f[R] can always be used to
override.
.PP
When only one profile is defined it is automatically the default.

sequentially performing the configured pruning, hard linking and
backups.
\f[B]-x\f[R] locks each profile as it runs (including \[lq]all\[rq]) so
that the same profile can\[cq]t be kicked off again until this run has
finished.
.TP
\f[B]managebackups -a \[en]nobackup\f[R]
Execute all currently defined profiles but don\[cq]t perform backups
\[en] only pruning and linking as configured within each profile.
.TP
\f[B]managebackups \[en]directory /opt/backups \[en]file pegasus.tgz \[en]cmd \[lq]ssh pegasus tar -czf - /home\[rq] \[en]scp me\[at]remoteserver:/var/backups/{subdir}/{file} \[en]prune \[en]fp\f[R]
Tar up /home from the pegasus server and store it in
/opt/backups/YYYY/MM/pegasus-YYYYMMDD.tgz.
Prune and link with default settings, though only prune if there\[cq]s a
recent backup (failsafe paranoid setting).
On success SCP the backup to remoteserver.
.TP
\f[B]managebackups \[en]directory /my/backups \[en]prune\f[R]
Prune (via default thresholds) and update links on all backups found in
/my/backups.
Without \f[B]\[en]file\f[R] or \f[B]\[en]command\f[R] no new backup is
performed/taken.
This can be used to manage backups that are performed by another tool
entirely.
Note: There may be profiles defined with different retention thresholds
for a subset of files in /my/backups (i.e.\ files that match the
\f[B]\[en]file\f[R] setting); those retention thresholds would be
ignored for this run because no \f[B]\[en]profile\f[R] is specified.
.TP
\f[B]managebackups -p mymac \[en]recreate \[en]test\f[R]
Recreate the mymac config file using the standard format.
Previously existing comments and formatting is thrown away.
The \f[B]-test\f[R] option skips all primary functions (no backups,
pruning or linking is done) so only the config file is updated.
.SS Faub-Style Backups
.TP
\f[B]managebackups -p artemis \[en]directory /opt/backups \[en]faub \[lq]ssh artemis managebackups \[en]path /usr/local/bin \[en]path /etc\[rq] \[en]prune \[en]fp \[en]save\f[R]
Take a new faub-style backup of server artemis\[cq] /etc and
/usr/local/bin directories, saving them locally to /opt/backups.
Prune older copies of this backup that have aged out.
Note: faub-backups assume \f[B]managebackups\f[R] is installed on the
remote (in this case artemis) server.
This example also assumes \f[B]managebackups\f[R] is installed suid-root
on both servers, otherwise one or both invocations of
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] would require sudo.
.SS General
.TP
\f[B]managebackups -1\f[R]
Show details of all backups taken that are associated with each profile.
Additionally \f[B]-p\f[R] [\f[I]profile\f[R]] could be specified to
limit the output to a single profile.
.TP
\f[B]managebackups -0\f[R]
Show a one-line summary for each backup profile.
The summary includes detail on the most recent backup as well as the
number of backups, age ranges and total disk space.

Identical output to above as this is a synonym for diffing the most recent backup to its immediate predecessor.  Additionally, if \[dq]laptop\[dq] is made the default profile (such as via **managebackups -p laptop --default --save**) the above command can be further simplified to **managebackups --last**.

\f[B]managebackups\f[R] uses three open-source libraries.
These are statically compiled in under MacOS and dynamically linked
under Linux.
.IP \[bu] 2
OpenSSL (1.1.1s) for calculation of MD5s
.IP \[bu] 2
pcre (8.45) for support of regular expressions
.IP \[bu] 2
pcre++ (0.9.5) as a C++ interface to pcre
.SH DISK USAGE
.PP
Disk usage is a nuanced concept.
Not only can it be reported in specific bytes (kilobytes, megabytes,
etc) used, it can also be reported in disk blocks used, since a full
block is the minimum allocatable space and anything less than that will
use a full block anyway.
By default, the `du' command reports in blocks.
Another complication is directory entries and symlinks (the directory
itself, not its contents; the symlink itself, not what it\[cq]s pointing
to).
They take up a small amount of space.
The stat() system call returns details on that space but for some reason
the `du' command ignores those.
\f[B]managebackups\f[R] provides two implmentations.
By default it reports specific bytes used.
Given the \f[B]\[en]blocks\f[R] option, it shows the blocks used.
In both cases, the tiny amount of space used by directories and symlinks
is ignored, again, like `du'.
