/* FastCache
 *
 * FastCache is an uncreative name just to distinguish from the existing caches of
 * BackupCache and FaubCache.  FastCache simply persists the text output of the
 * summary status command (i.e. "-0") to a file, along with the mtimes of the first
 * and last backup for each profile.  It facilitates printing the summary stats
 * near instantaneously, only having to calculate the current age of those two
 * mtimes.  The full -0 stats are quite fast as well, but with large backup sets do
 * require a stat() call on every file.  So this is faster.
 *
 * FastCache is updated every time linking, pruning or backing up is performed, as
 * well as any time a -0 stat output is requested.
